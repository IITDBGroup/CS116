    "In addition to **primitive** types, Java supports objects. In Java classes are organized into packages (each class belongs to exactly). \n",
    "The purpose of packages is to provide namespaces (you can defined two classes with the same name as long as they belong to different packages) and to provide a means to organize your code.\n",
    "Packages are organized hierarchically and elements in the hierarchy are separated by `.`. \n",
    "The rules what constitutes a valid package name are the same as for class, variable, field, and method names: [Naming Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-3.html#jls-JavaLetter). Most importantly, identifiers start with an letter followed by a sequenced of numbers and letter. A package name element cannot be the same as any identifiers defined in the language. It is idomatic to only use lower case letters in package names and to ensure worldwide uniqueness of package names by prefixing them with a reverse internet domain name. For instance, packages from `www.iit.edu` should be prefixed with `edu.iit.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `my_package.my_subpackage` **(OK)**\n",
    "* `MyPackage.MyOtherPackage` **(OK, but does not following naming conventions)**\n",
    "* `if` **(NOT OK, because `if` is a keyword in Java)**\n",
    "* `1MyPackage` **(NOT OK, starts with a number)**\n",
    "* `My1Package` **(OK, only the first character has to be a letter)**\n",
    "* `Äüö` **(OK, but maybe not recommendable to use non ASCII letters)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Java defines rules for how you have to organize your source code into directories and files. The source code of a class `A` has to be stored in a file called `A.java`. This file has to be stored in a directory structure that reflects the hierarchy of the name of the package a class belongs to. For example, if `A` belongs to package `edu.iit` then Java expects the directory structure to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "/edu/iit/A.java\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The file containing the source code of a class has to have the following structure (here `?` denotes optional elements:\n",

    "```\n",
    "<package_declaration>\n",
    "<imports>?\n",
    "\n",
    "<modifiers> <class_name> <extends>? <implements>? {\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The package declaration determines what package the class belongs to. It is the form `package <package_name>;`. For instance, if we define a class in package `edu.iit.` the package declaration is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "package edu.iit;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `<imports>` section allows you to import classes from other packages that are then available for use withing the class we are defining. More about that later below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `<modifiers>` determine the visibility of a class and other characteristics (more below). \n",
    "\n",
    "* The optional `<extends>` determines the super class of the class we are defining (more about that when we talk about inheritance below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The optional  `<implements>` part specifies which **interfaces** the class implements. We will dedicate a separate part of the course to interfaces.\n",

Note that if we call the constructor of a superclass within the constructor for a subclass, this has to be the first statment in the constructor of the subclass. Furthermore, we made use of overriding which allows a subclass to redefine a method defined by a superclass. In this particular example, we want the `toString` method to tell us that the object is a bike and whether it is a sports bike. We have achieved this by overriding the `toString` method. For understandability you can annotate a overriden class using `@Override`. This is optional. We will talk more about annotations later.\n"

    "# Constructors and Creating Objects (Instances of a class)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, there are no object variables, but all variables are references. Objects are created by using the `new` operator, e.g., `new Integer(1)` creates an instance (object) of class `Integer`. `new` calls the appropriate **constructor** of the class based on the types of arguments passed in parenthesis to the `new` operator. Constructors are special functions in a class that have the same name as the class and for which no return value is specified. Note that constructors are also subject to inheritance and the root class `Object` defines a default constructor. That is, for our `MyFirstClass` calling `new MyFirstClass()` ended up calling the default constructor."
