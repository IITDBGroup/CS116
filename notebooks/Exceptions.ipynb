    "# Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we learn about exception handling in Java. Exceptions allow the current flow of control to be interrupted. In Java exceptions are objects that are instances of a class derived from the class `Exception`. Exceptions enable a controlled way of handling error conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Throwing Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception can be thrown using the `throw` statement like this: `<throw> <exception>;`. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "throw new Exception(\"an error occurred\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception is thrown, unless the code throwing the exception is surounded by a `try` statement (explained below), control is handed over to the caller of the current method. This process is repeated until either a try-catch block is hit or the exception is rethrown by the `main` method in which case the program terminates and an error message is printed. This approach allows the programmer to decide where to deal with an exceptional condition. This is quite useful, because the code throwing an exception to indicate an error may not have sufficient information to deal with this error locally."
