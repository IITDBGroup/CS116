    "\n",
    "`java.io` provides several types of abstractions for \n",
    "\n",
    "## Input and Output Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic mechnism for I/O in the `java.io` framework are the `InputStream` [https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/InputStream.html](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/InputStream.html) and `OutputStream` abstract classes [https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/OutputStream.html](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/OutputStream.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "These allow reading (`InputStream`) and writing (`OutputStream`) **binary data** in a **blocking** fashion. That is once you call a method to read or write from a stream, the execution of your program is paused while waiting for a result (unless an Exception is thrown to be thrown). We already discussed some I/O related concepts when talking about exception handling. Let us discuss some methods of `InputStream` and `OutputStream`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **InputStream**\n",
    "    * `close()` - closes the stream and releases all system resources associated with it. Always close streams when you are done with them!\n",
    "    * `int available()` - returns an estimate of the number of bytes that are available for reading\n",
    "    * `int read()` - reads a single byte from the stream. This method blocks until a byte is available.\n",
    "    * `int read (byte[] b)` - reads a number of bytes into buffer `b` and returns the number of bytes that have been read\n",
    "* **OutputStream**\n",
    "    * `close()` - closes the stream and releases all system resources associated with it. Always close streams when you are done with them!\n",
    "    * `write (int b)` - write a single byte to the output stream\n",
    "    * `write(byte[] b)` - write the content of byte array `b` to the output stream\n",
    "    * `flush()` - flushes this output stream which causes any buffered content (if the outputstream does buffering) to be written out\n",
    "    \n",
    "Some noteworthy subclasses are:\n",
    "* `FileInputStream` - which reads data from a file\n",
    "* `FileOutputStream` - writes data to a file\n",
    "* `BufferedInputStream` - wraps another input stream and adds buffers reads\n",
    "* `BufferedOutputStream` - wraps an output stream and adds buffering of writes\n",
    "* `ObjectInputStream` - read primitive java values and objects from an input stream in a machine-architecture independent way (data is expected to have been written by `ObjectOutputStream`. Only classes that implement the interface `java.io.Serializable` or `java.io.Externalizable` can be read or written using this meachnism.\n",
    "* `ObjectOutputStream` - write primitive java values and objects as explained above for `ObjectInputStream`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reader and Writer\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstract `Reader` and `Writer` classes are superclasses for all classes that read or write **character streams**. The main difference input and output streams is that data is interpreted as characters instead of raw bytes. Relevant methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reader**\n",
    "    * `close()` - close the stream and release resources\n",
    "    * `boolean ready()` - is the stream ready for reading?\n",
    "    * `int read()` - reads a single character\n",
    "    * `int read(char[] cbuf)` - reads characters into buffer `cbuf`, returns the number of characters that were read\n",
    "    * `skip(long n)` - skips `n` characters\n",
    "* **Writer**\n",
    "    * `close()` and `flush()` behave like for streams\n",
    "    * `write(String str)` - write the content of string to the writer\n",
    "    \n",
    "Some subclasses of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `StringReader` - reads from a String.\n",
    "* `StringWriter` - writes to a StringBuffer\n",
    "* `BufferedReader/Writer` - buffers a reader or writer\n",
    "* `InputStreamReader` - wraps an input stream to read characters from it\n",
    "* `FileReader/Writer` - reads/writes from/to a file"
