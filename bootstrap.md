## First Steps

### Install the Java Development Environment


### Use the excellent Java documentation

Java provides quite a lot of functionality out of the box. It is easy to get overwhelmed. Finding out what classes exist and what interface they provide is easy using Java's online documentation: [https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html)

### Learn how to use Java's toolchain

### Learn how to use an IDE and/or Programmers Texteditor

Using the right tools will greatly enhance your programming experience. You want to setup a and learn how to use a good Java IDE and/or programmers text editor. Also see [here](https://xkcd.com/378/). Following is a (highly biased) selection of IDEs and Editors you may want to check out:

#### IDEs

* **Eclipse**: One of the best Java IDEs (also support for many other languages can be added): [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* **NetBeans**: Has been open sourced, but not all functionality available for newer Java versions yet. Otherwise, a great IDE: [https://netbeans.org/](https://netbeans.org/)
* Or if you prefer cloud IDEs **CodeEnvy**: [https://codenvy.io/](https://codenvy.io/)

#### Editors

* **Emacs**: slow learning curve, but extremly powerful and extensible if you do not mind the odd keyboard shortcuts: [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* **Vi**: very fast, low resource consumption, extremly powerful and extensible: [https://www.vim.org/](https://www.vim.org/)
* **Atom**: [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)
* **Visual Studio code**: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
