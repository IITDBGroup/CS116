	## Analyzing the complexity of algorithms

	* Given an algorithm for a problem we would like to understand how the **runtime** and or **space** consumption of the algorithm is influenced by the size of the algorithm's input

  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Time Complexity
	* We typically use $n$ to denote the size of the algorithms input and $T(n)$ to denote how much time the algorithm needs to process an input of size $n$

  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Space Complexity

	* When measuring space complexity, we typically do not consider the input as part of the sapce needed by the algorithm
	* Here we focus mainly on time complexity

	## Example

	* Consider an algorithm that takes an integer array as input and returns true if the array contains the integer 0 by looping through the elements of the array until the end is reached or 0 has been found
	* **Input size**: the number of elements in the array
	* **Runtime**: ?

	## Problems with our example

	1. The runtime does not just depend on how large the input is, but also on whether it contains $0$ and if yes where in the array the first $0$ is stored!
	2. The actual time it takes to iterate over the array depends on which computer we are executing an implementation of the algorithm on
	  * Some computers are faster than others
	  * Compilers translate higher-level languages into assembly or the instruction set of a VM. This further complicates life

	## Different Types of Complexity

	* To address **problem 1.** we distinguish between:
	* **Worst-case complexity**: the maximal runtime across all inputs of size $n$
	  * Interpretation: our algorithm will never be slower than this for a given input size
  </textarea>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Different Types of Complexity

	* and ...
	* **Average-case complexity**: the runtime averaged over all inputs of size $n$ (optionally weighted by a probability distribution over the inputs)
	  * Interpretation: given some randomly selected input of size $n$, this is it runtime we can expect
  </textarea>

	## Making complexity independent of machines

	* To address **problem 2.** we use a measure of runtime that is machine-independent:
	  1. We assume that the runtime of our algorithm will only differ by a constant factor if run on different machines
	    * **Note**: this assumption is typically violated in reality, but is still a reasonable assumption

	## Making complexity independent of machines

	* To address **problem 2.** we use a measure of runtime that is machine-independent:
	  2. We use a notation that allows us to express runtime ignoring constant factors
	    * The **Big-O** notation introduced next fulfills this requirement

	# Big-O Notation
  </textarea>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Big-O Notation

	* When measuring the computational complexity of an algorithm given the size of its input we want to abstract from unncessary details
	* We are interested in the big picture, e.g., does the algorithm take linear time or qudratic time rather than does it talk 15,003 times the input plus 300,456 instructutions to run
	* Big-O notation is suited well for this purpose, because it expresses the asymtotic growth of a function

	## Big-O Notation

	* Given a function $f(x)$ we say that $f(x) \in O(g(x))$ if there exists constants $c$ and $x_0$ such that
	$$\forall x > x_0: f(x) \leq c \cdot g(x)$$
	* Inituively, this means that $g$ grows at least as fast as $f$
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Big-O Notation for time complexity

	* How does this notation help us with our problem?
	* Constant factors are ignored because if $f(x) \in O(g(x))$ then also $c \cdot f(x) \in O(g(x))$
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Import growth factors

	* $O(1)$ is constant time
	* $O(\log n)$ is logarithmic time
	* $O(n)$ is linear time
	* $O(n \cdot \log n)$ is log-linear time
	* $O(n^2)$ is quadratic time
	* $O(n^a)$ for some $a \geq 1$ is polynominal time
	* $O(2^n)$ is exponential time

	## Worst-case complexity

	* Let us first analyze the worst-case complexity of our search for zero algorithm
	* Clearly the worst-case input is one that does not contain zero since we will loop through all elements of the input array ($n$)
	* How many array elements do we need to process?
	  * All of them ($n$)
  </textarea>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Worst-case complexity

	* How many instructions are needed to process one element in the array?
	  * Not clear, bu it does not matter as long as this number is constant (it does not depend on how large the array is)
	* So let's say that we need at most $c$ instructions to process one elements, then $T(n) \leq c \cdot n$.
	* Thus, $T(n) \in O(n)$, i.e., our algorithm has **worst-case linear complexity**
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Average-case complexity

	* Now we need to consider all possible inputs (and provide a probability distribution)
	* The runtime of our algorithm is only affected by where in the array we have the first zero (because we stop once we have found one zero)
	* Let us assume that the position of the zero is uniformly distributed, i.e., each position including the case where zero is not in the array has the same probability
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Average-case complexity

	* For the first zero at position $z$ and assuming that we do not need more than $c$ instructions per element:
	$$T(n) \leq c \cdot z$$
	* Averaging over all possible positions:
	$$\frac{\sum_{i=0}^n T(i) + n}{n} \leq c \cdot \frac{n \cdot (n + 1)}{n \cdot 2} = c \cdot \frac{n+1}{2} \in O(n) $$
	* That is, the average-case complexity of our algorithm is in $O(n)$
