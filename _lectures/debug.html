	## What is a software bug?

	* A **bug** is an error in a program
	  * May lead to crashes
	  * May lead to incorrect behavior
  </textarea>

	## What is debugging?

	* **Debugging** is the action of tracing and fixing bugs
	* What activities are involved in debugging?
	  * Read source code
	  * Run program for test inputs and observe its output
	  * Use a **debugger** to inspect what happens during program execution
  </textarea>
</section>

	## What is a debugger

	* A **Debugger** is a program that allows a user to control the execution of a program and inspect its state
	* This entails:
	  * **Controlling execution**
	  * **Inspecting and modifying variable state**
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Controlling Execution

	* Most debuggers allow ...
	  * Pausing the execution of the program
	  * Executing one statement at a time in a stepwise manner
	  * Set **breakpoints**: statements where the debugger will automatically stop execution when they are executed
	  * **watchpoints**: expressions whose value is tracked during program execution

	# Testing
  </textarea>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Software Testing

	* **black-box testing** - test the functionality of a piece of software irrespective of its internas
	* **white-box testing** - testing the interal components of a piece of software and not just it's compliance with an API specification
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Black-box testing

   * In black-box testing we only use the external API of a piece of software and check whether it complies with its specification, but do not test internas of compontents that implement the API
   * For instance, if we have a implementation of a List datastructure as a singly linked list then we can test whether the length of the list is 1 after inserting one element into an empty list, but we will not test whether it elements are linked correctly since this is not part of the API of a List
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## White-box testing

	* In white-box testing the implementation of a component is taken into account when testing. That is, we also test internal implementation details.
	* For instance, if we have a implementation of a List datastructure as a singly linked list then we would also test that the pointers of the linked cells are correct

	## Testing in Java with JUnit

	* **JUnit** is a testing framework for Java
	* In Junit you use annotations to mark the methods of a class as test cases
	   * `@Test` marks a method as a test case
	* In test case methods you can compare expected results against actual results
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## JUnit Testcase

	```java
	public class MyTestCases {

	     @Test
	     public void testOne() {
	     ...
	     }

	     ...
	}
	```
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## JUnit Assertions

	* Assertions are used to test conditions. JUnit stops a test case and considers it failed as long as an assertion method called from the test case failes
	* For instance, `assertEquals(a,b)` fails the test case if `a` is not equal to be `b`
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## JUnit Assertions

	```java
	...
	@Test
	public void test() {
	   assertEquals(1,1); // test succesful so far
	   assertEquals(2,3); // this fails the test
	}
	```
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Test Suites

	* JUnit allows test cases to be grouped hierarchically into test suites
	* This is done by defining a new class without any content and specify through annotation which packages and/or test classes should be part of the suite
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Test Suites

```java
@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class) // run this suite with JUnit
@SelectClasses( { MyFirstTestClass.class, MySecondTestClass }) // array of Class objects for test classes to make part of the suite
@SelectPackages( { "edu.iit.mytests" } ) // array of names of package that contain test classes that should be part of the suite
public class MySuite
{
}
```
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Running Tests with JUnit

	* JUnit provides both a commandline method as well as a GUI framework for running tests
	* Tests are represented in a tree structure based on their hierarchical organization into suites and test classes
	* A test corresponding to a class is consider succesful if all of the test methods of this class are succesful
	* A test suite is successful if all the packages and classes of the suite are successful

	# Logging
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Logging

	* Logging means outputting messages during program execution to expose state and events in program execution
	* We already saw simple logging using `System.out.printf` and `System.out.println`
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Disadvantages of Logging with System.out

	* No support for selectively turning on/off logging
	* No support for re-routing log output (e.g., to a file)
	* No support for formatting log output (e.g., print class which creates the log output)
  </textarea>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	## Java Built-in Logging

	* `Logger` objects are used to send log output. Each Logger has a name. It is customary to create a separate logger for each class using the name of the class
	```java
	public class MyClass {
	private final Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(MyClass.class);
	```
	* `Handler` objects process log messages, e.g., output them to files
	* `Formatter` objects format log messages
	* Log levels - assign log messages to a priority

	## Testing vs. Debugging vs. Logging

	* Debugging is a **reactive** technique
	  * Once a bug is observed we debug the program
	* Testing is a **proactive** technique
	  * Before deploying our program we run tests to determine whether it is behaving as expected
	* Logging is a type of **provisioning**
	  * We add log outputs to ease debugging and retroactive analysis of errors
  </textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
	# Summary

	* **Testing**
	  * checking whether our program behaves correctly
	* **Logging**
	  * Output sensible information during program execution to ease (offline and online) debugging
	* **Debugging**
	  * Finding and removing the cause of a bug
