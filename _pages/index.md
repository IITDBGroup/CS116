# Overview

This course teaches you object-oriented programming using Java as our programming language of choice. Being a skillful programmer requires many skills including:

* **Know your tools**
  * You should learn how to use IDEs and/or programming text editors
	  * learn its keyboard shortcuts!
  * You need to learn how to use a version control system like **git**
	  * these keep track of versions of your source code and allow you to collaborate with others
  * You need to learn how to use the shell
	* many tasks are more effective to be done from a shell
	* over remote connections this maybe the only access you have to a machine
* **Understand your language**
  * You need to understand the syntax of your language, its semantics, and its ecosystem
* **Understand programming paradigms**
  * In this course we focus on **imperative** programming, specifically **object-orient programming**
* **Know your algorithms**
  *  algorithms
* **Code comprehension**
  *
* **Debugging and Testing**
  * know how to use the Java debugger and

We briefly touch on all of these, but with a focus on the object-oriented programming paradigm and the Java language.
