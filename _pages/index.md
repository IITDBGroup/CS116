# Overview

This course teaches you object-oriented programming using Java as our programming language of choice.

* **Getting started**: install Java and familize yourself with tools: [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/bootstrap.html)
* **Labs**: additional information about labs: [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/labs.html)
* **Lecture**: overview of content covered in the lectures: [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/lectures.html)


<!-- Being a skillful programmer requires many skills including: -->

<!-- * **Know your tools** -->
<!--   * You should learn how to use IDEs and/or programming text editors -->
<!-- 	  * learn its keyboard shortcuts! -->
<!--   * You need to learn how to use a version control system like **git** -->
<!-- 	  * these keep track of versions of your source code and allow you to collaborate with others -->
<!--   * You need to learn how to use the shell -->
<!-- 	* many tasks are more effective to be done from a shell -->
<!-- 	* over remote connections this maybe the only access you have to a machine -->
<!-- * **Understand your language** -->
<!--   * You need to understand the syntax of your language, its semantics, and its ecosystem -->
<!-- * **Understand programming paradigms** -->
<!--   * In this course we focus on **imperative** programming, specifically **object-orient programming** -->
<!-- * **Know your algorithms** -->
<!--   *  algorithms -->
<!-- * **Code comprehension** -->
<!--   * -->
<!-- * **Debugging and Testing** -->
<!--   * know how to use the Java debugger and -->

<!-- We briefly touch on all of these, but with a focus on the object-oriented programming paradigm and the Java language. -->
