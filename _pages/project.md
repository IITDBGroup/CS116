The project consists of a design part and an implementation part. The design part is due on {{ site.data.course.due.project_design }} and an implementation part that is due {{ site.data.course.due.project_implementation }}.
We will create a git repository for each student  in the course on [bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) which you have to use to submit the project. For more information about git see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/bootstrap.html#learn-how-to-use-git).
