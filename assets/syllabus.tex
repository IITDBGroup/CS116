{\large \noindent\textbf{Students with Disabilities}}

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S. State St., room 1C3-2 (on the first floor), telephone 312 567.5744 or \url{disabilities@iit.edu}.

{\large \noindent\textbf{Piazza}}

his term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

{\large \noindent \textbf{Course Objectives} }

Students should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze and explain the behavior of simple programs involving the following fundamental programming constructs: assignment, I/O (including file I/O), selection, iteration, functions, pointers
\item Write a program that uses each of the following fundamental programming constructs: assignment, I/O (including file I/O), selection, iteration, functions, pointers
\item Break a problem into logical pieces that can be solved (programmed) independently.
\item Develop, and analyze, algorithms for solving simple problems.
\item Use a suitable programming language, and development environment, to implement, test, and debug algorithms for solving simple problems.
\item Write programs that use each of the following data structures (and describe how they are represented in memory): strings, arrays, structures, and class libraries including strings and vectors
\item Explain the basics of the concept of recursion.
\item Write, test, and debug simple recursive functions and procedures.
\item Explain and apply object-oriented design and testing involving the following concepts: data abstraction, encapsulation, information hiding, sub-classing, inheritance, templates
\item Use a development environment to design, code, test, and debug simple programs, including multi-file source projects, in an object-oriented programming language.
\item Solve problems by creating and using sequential search, binary search, and quadratic sorting algorithms (selection, insertion)
\item Determine the time complexity of simple algorithms.
